### Weather Database
- Create a list of 2000 random coordinates and find the closest city.
- To create a city database, use an API call with the OpenWeatherMap to add city weather data.
### Vacation Search
- Use input to customize weather preferences 
- Identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels by the preferences
- Show destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers
### Vacation Itinerary
- Use Google directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities from Australia 
- Create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for the four cities
## Conclusion
A beta version of a customizable filtering tool for the PlanMyTrip app has been created for trip planning based on customer preferences and itinerary planning, which can be applied to other travel apps.
